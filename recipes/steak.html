            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it taste steakhouse quality. You’ll be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak – seared and caramelized on the outside, and so juicy inside.</p>
                <p>Thank you to <strong><em>Beef.It’s What’s for Dinner.</em></strong> on behalf of the Beef Checkoff for sponsoring this garlic butter steak recipe. I received compensation, but all opinions are my own.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, divided</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
                    <li>1 beef flat iron steak or boneless top sirloin steak (3/4 pound)</li>
                    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1/8 teaspoon pepper</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mix 1 tablespoon butter with parsley, garlic and soy sauce.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle steak with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat remaining butter over medium heat. Add steak; cook until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a thermometer should read 135°; medium, 140°; medium-well, 145°), 4-7 minutes per side. Serve with garlic butter.</li>
