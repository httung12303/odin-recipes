            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I tested this <strong><em>homemade baked French fries</em></strong> recipe a gazillion times to get it just right! The easy oven fries are crispy yet tender, and they have an incredible flavor thanks to a few simple ingredients (beware: the fries are seriously addicting!). Pair them with burgers, meats or fish, or devour them all on their own. I’ll show you the simple techniques for making perfect oven fries every single time. </p>
            <h2>Key ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Granulated garlic:</strong> the fries are sprinkled with <em>granulated garlic</em> (or you can use garlic powder) before baking, giving them a rich, addicting flavor. You could also try a sprinkle of chili powder for another flavor variation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chives and parsley:</strong> if you’ve ever had onion dip with potato chips, you know how much chives love potatoes (and vice versa!). These fries are sprinkled with fresh chives and parsley when they come out of the oven, taking them over the top.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grated parmesan cheese (optional)</strong> freshly grated parmesan cheese is the icing on the cake, giving the fries an irresistible cheesy, umami flavor.</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Soak the potatoes in very hot tap water for 10-15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Drain the potatoes, then use a kitchen towel to pat them very dry.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle the fries with olive oil and add seasonings, then spread them in a single layer on a large baking sheet.</li>
                    <li>Bake the fries at 450 degrees for 35 minutes, flipping them over after 20 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
